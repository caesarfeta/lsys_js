# lsys\_js

lsys_js is an L-System generator and a collection of renderers written in Javascript.
L-Systems are algorithms for generating recursive patterns.

## Renderers
2D
3D

The 3D renderer accepts a callback function as a parameter that can be used to set the z value of a point in the L-System.

Interesting effects can be created.  Things like warps and deformations.
